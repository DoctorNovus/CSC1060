# Problem 1

Convert miles to kilometers and kilometers to miles.  Write a program that reads in a double value as miles from the console.  Then, take that mile value to convert it to kilometers.  Then, display the results in kilometers.  Then, read in a double value as kilometers, convert it to miles, and then display the value in miles.

The formula for converting a value from miles to kilometers is:

`1 mile = 1.6 kilometers`

## Output Example:
```
Enter the value of a mile: 96
96 miles is 154.497 kilometers.
Enter the value of kilometers: 8497.1
8497.1 kilometers is 5279.85316 miles.
```

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.

# Problem 2

Calculate a tip for a meal.  Write a program that reads the total amount of the bill.  Then, ask for what percentage should be used for the tip calculation.  Then, output the tip amount and the total amount (bill + tip).

## Output Example:
```
Enter Bill Total: 19.40
Enter Tip %: 20
Tip Amount: 3.88
Total Bill + Tip: 23.28
```

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.

# Problem 3

Multiply the digits in an integer value.  Write a program that reads an integer from 1 to 9999.  The program will assume only 4-digit numbers will be used.  Then, the program should multiply all the digits in the integer.  For example, if the integer is 1932, the answer should be 54.  1 * 9 * 3 * 2 = 54.

Hints:

- Use the % operator to extract digits.
- Use the / operator to remove the extracted digit.
- Example: 1932 % 10 = 2 and 1932 / 10 = 193.

## Output Example:
```
Enter an integer: 1932
Answer: 54
Enter an integer: 66
Answer: 36
```

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.

# Problem 4

Health application to compute someone's BMI.  Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight.  It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by the square of your height in meters.  Write a program that prompts the user to enter weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI results.

## Output Example:
```
Enter Weight (pounds) : 178
Enter Height (inches) : 75
BMI Value : 22.2
```

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.
