Assignment EC14

Each problem is worth 5 points.  To get the 5 points per problem, the problem needs to be 100% correct, functioning, and readable.

Problem 1:

Geometry: intersecting point. Suppose two line segments intersect. The two endpoints for the first line segment are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and for the second line segment are (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).

Write a program that prompts the user to enter these four endpoints and displays the intersecting point. As discussed in the book (Programming Exercise 3.25), the intersecting point can be found by solving a linear equation. Use the LinearEquation class in Assignment 13 Problem 3 to solve this equation. 

Problem 2:

Guess the capitals. Write a program that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a capital for a state.  The program should "shuffle" the states around, so they are not in the same order every time the program is executed.  The program should tell the user which state its asking about and give 4 options for capitals as choices. Upon receiving the user input, the program reports whether the answer is correct.  The program prompts the user to answer all states’ capitals and displays the total correct count. The user’s answer is not case-sensitive.

Two approaches to the 50 state and capital information:

One approach is to use a two-dimensional array.
Second option is to create a class to store the state information and then store the class in a one-dimensional array.
