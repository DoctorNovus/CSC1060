All problems must use an array to store values.

Problem 1

Assign grades - Write a program that reads student scores and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:

Grade is A if score is >= 90
Grade is B if score is >= 80
Grade is C if score is >= 70
Grade is D if score is >= 60
Grade is F otherwise.
The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts the user to enter all scores, and concludes by displaying the grades.

Output Example:

Enter the number of students: 4
Enter 4 scores: 40 75 91 78
Student 0 score is 40 and grade is F
Student 1 score is 75 and grade is C
Student 2 score is 91 and grade is A
Student 3 score is 78 and grade is C

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.

Problem 2

Comparing numbers - Write a program that reads 11 integers, compares each integer with the 11th integer, and displays whether the integers are “greater”, “smaller”, or “equal” to the 11th integer.

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct. 

Problem 3

Counting numbers - Write a program that reads in integers. Then, display the total number of even and odd numbers.  Then, display the total count for each number displayed in a table.  Don't show numbers that were not provided. Input of integers ends when a 0 is entered.  Make sure the code can handle any integers. 

Output Example:

Enter numbers: 1 2 5 2 1 8 3 4 3 2 3 4 8 9 9 0
The number of odd numbers: 8
The number of even numbers: 7
## | Count
----------
1  | 2
2  | 3
3  | 3
4  | 2
5  | 1
8  | 2
9  | 2

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.

Problem 4

The Sieve of Eratosthenes - The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm that finds all prime numbers up to a given limit, n. It creates an array of Booleans (flags) of size n+1.  Then, initialize all values in the array to true (assuming every number is a prime number in the beginning).  Next, iteratively traverse the array, starting with the number 2 to n, setting the values to false of indices that are multiples of that number. Write a program using the described algorithm above and display all the prime numbers up to n.  n can be any integer value.

Output Example:

Max Number to check: 55
Primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.
