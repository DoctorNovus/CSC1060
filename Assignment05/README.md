Use the while or the do-while loop for all of the following problems.

Problem 1

Pass or fail: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a grade score. If the score is greater or equal to 60, display “you pass the exam”; otherwise, display “you don’t pass the exam”. Your program ends with a grade score of -1.

Output Example:

Enter your score: 80
You pass the exam
Enter your score: 55
You didn't pass the exam
Enter your score: -1

Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.

Problem 2

Financial application that computes future tuition: Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and increases 6% every year. In one year, the tuition will be $10,600. Write a program that computes the tuition in Y number of years and the total cost of four years’ worth of tuition after the Yth year.

Inputs:

Initial tuition ($10,000)
Percent yearly increase (6%)
How many years (Y) to start calculating 4 years of tuition?
Output:

Provide good prompts to the user.
Provide good information about the results.
Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.

Problem 3

Conversion from Cº to Fº and Fº to Cº: Write a program that displays the following
two tables side by side:
Celsius Fahrenheit | Fahrenheit Celsius
0           32.000 | 20          −6.667
2           35.600 | 25          −3.889
...
98         208.400 | 265        129.444
100        212.000 | 270        132.222

Input:

The starting Fahrenheit value.
If this value is not a multiple of 5, then update the number to the closest multiple of 5.  For example: if given 21, start at 20.  if given 24, start at 25.
Output:

The table above with the 51 rows of data.
Formate the table as shown above.
Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.

Problem 4

The game of Rock-Paper-Scissors:  Write a program to play this game against the computer.  Keep score. The game is over after one opponent has scored three (3) more points than the other.

Input:

The user's selection:
1 -Rock
2 -Paper
3 -Scissors
Output:

The current Score
Both players' choices and outcome
Prompt for the user's choice.
Make sure the values generated in the code/program are correct.  The output does not have to match the example 100%.
