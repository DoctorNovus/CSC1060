# CSC1060

During Spring 2024, I attended Arapahoe Community College, and this class (CSC1060) was my Computer Science I class. All folders the different assignments assigned, with my own experience added (such that I was "overdoing" it in the earlier assignments).

For students taking CSC 1060 and see this in the future, you are welcome to view the code, but I challenge you to "make it your own", adding your own implementation.
